                <div class="full-text">
                    I am Wubshet Adane, an excited, committed, and motivated software engineer with a passion for creating impactful and innovative solutions. 
                    My expertise spans software requirement engineering, the software development life cycle, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and problem-solving. 
                    I am proficient in frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Sass, JavaScript, jQuery, React.js, and Angular.js, and skilled in backend development with PHP, Laravel, and MVC architecture. With strong database management skills, including expertise in MySQL and MongoDB, I excel in designing, managing, and optimizing data systems. 
                    I have successfully accomplished projects like a guest management system, an online food ordering system, and various personal websites. 
                    Driven by a passion for excellence, I continuously enhance my skills, embrace challenges, and stay committed to delivering top-notch solutions.
                    <strong>As a software engineer, I live by the principles reflected in these quotes:</strong>
                    <ul class="aboutme-quotes">
                        <li>
                            "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand." 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            "Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute."
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            "First, solve the problem. Then, write the code."
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            "Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad." 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    These principles remind me to focus on writing clean, maintainable, and effective code, ensuring my solutions stand the test of time.
